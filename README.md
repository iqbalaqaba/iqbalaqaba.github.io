# 2.0 Portfolio website docs
I'm trying to create a minimalistic and material likes portfolio website. I already create the original mockups for this website. But when in production phase, i adjust some UI ( again ). I made this portfolio website using [UIkit Framework](https://github.com/uikit/uikit).

Mockup can be found on my behance profile by [clicking here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/68034339/One-page-portfolio-ui-concept)

## Plugin Used :
- Typed JS for the typing effect. [Github link here](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
- Emoji by [Getemoji.com](https://getemoji.com)
